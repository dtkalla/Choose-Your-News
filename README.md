# MERN Project: Choose Your News


With so much news going on in the world all the time, it's impossible to keep up with all of it.  [Choose your news](https://choose-your-news.onrender.com/) is a news aggregating service that lets you get news about specific figures you choose to follow. You can organize these figures into different groups based on topic, as well as save specific news articles and share your groups with other users.

## With Choose Your News, users can:

- #### See news about figures they follow

News about followed figures is pulled live using the NYTimes API based on headlines and shown in a stream, similar to a social media newsfeed.  Pages show the most recent ten relevant articles, organized from most to least recent.

- #### Organize figures they follow into groups

<!-- ![](images/reservation_form.png) -->

Users can create groups to hold different figures they follow.  In addition to helping with organization, this lets users view three different types news streams: one for all figures they follow (on the home/index page), one for each group the follow, and one for each individual figure.  Users can move figures into and out of groups.



- #### Save articles from their news feed

Users can bookmark interesting articles to their profiles, which will save these articles and allow the user to go back to them in the future.  Articles are organized by the figure they're associated with.

<!-- - #### See ratings and reviews; rate/review a property

Users can read reviews of each listing, see ratings, and leave their own ratings/reviews.  This is *not* a full CRUD feature -- like AirBnb, WaterBnb doesn't allow users to delete or modify reviews, because it could create a conflict of interest.  Average rating is stored with each listing and dynamically recalculated whenever a user rates a property.  (For purposes of being a better demo, logged-in users can rate/review any property, but they can't rate/review the same property more than once in a day.) -->
